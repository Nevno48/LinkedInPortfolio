This is where I put files I have worked on in the past. The projects are mainly from Siena Summer Academic camps, Urban Scholars, and research.

Other works I included in my portfolio are works from my favorite creative arts classes: Photography, and Graphic Design.

Urban Scholars: The program brings students from downtown Albany to Siena to learn more steam/stem offered classes. Some classes offered were: Minecraft Galacticraft, Minecraft Industrialcraft, FLOSS, and Making Mods in Minecraft. 
Summer Academic Camps: Siena provided summer camps for local students to learn more steam/stem topics during the summer. Some classes offered were: Quantum Physics in Minecraft, Raspberry Pi camp. FLOSS, Construct 2, and Lego Robotics.

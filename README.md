This is where I put files I have worked on in the past. The projects are mainly from Siena Summer Academic camps, Urban Scholars, and research.

Other works I included in my portfolio are works from my favorite creative arts classes: Photography, and Graphic Design.

Urban Scholars: The program brings students from downtown Albany to Siena to learn more steam/stem offered classes. Some classes offered were: Minecraft Galacticraft, Minecraft Industrialcraft, FLOSS, and Making Mods in Minecraft. 
Summer Academic Camps: Siena provided summer camps for local students to learn more steam/stem topics during the summer. Some classes offered were: Quantum Physics in Minecraft, Raspberry Pi camp. FLOSS, Construct 2, and Lego Robotics. 
Siena CURCA Research: Siena's Center for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activity(CURCA) provided me to do research with a physics professor, Dr. McColgan, to develop physics applications that utilize Augmented Reality(AR) functionality.

Photography: I took 2 photography classes at Siena College that instructed me on how to use a camera and edit photos. After learning I continued to pursue and explore photography outside of my classes. 
Graphic Design: Throughout my class life in high school and College, I learned the importance of how the use of an image manipulation program can be used for. I took a class in high school and college to further develop my skills in different graphic design software.
